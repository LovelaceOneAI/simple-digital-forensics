# Simple Digital Forensics Tool

A basic Python script to simulate recovering deleted data from a disk image based on a known signature.

## How It Works

- Scans a binary file (e.g., a simulated disk image) for a special signature.
- If found, attempts to recover a small portion of the "deleted" data.

## Usage

```bash
python forensics_recovery.py
